## üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture

This application follows a clean, three-layer architecture ensuring clear separation of concerns and maintainability.

### 1. UI Layer (`src/components` & `src/pages`)

- **Pages:** Top-level route components (`Dashboard`, `Wardrobe`, `Calendar`, etc.)
- **Components:** Reusable UI elements organized by feature domains
- **Layouts:** Consistent page structure with responsive navigation
- **Modals:** Specialized dialogs for complex workflows (AddCloth, CreateOutfit, etc.)

### 2. State Management Layer (`src/stores`)

Feature-specific Zustand stores providing "single source of truth":

- `useAuthStore` - Authentication and user session management
- `useWardrobeStore` - Clothing and outfit data management
- `useCalendarStore` - Activity logging and calendar state
- `useLaundryStore` - Laundry workflow management
- `useThemeStore` - Theme and UI preferences
- `useSettingsStore` - User settings and preferences
- `useInsightsStore` - Analytics and insights data

### 3. Service Layer (`src/services`)

Business logic and data persistence with stateless, reusable functions:

- `ClothService` - CRUD operations for clothing items
- `OutfitService` - Outfit management and combinations
- `StorageService` - Data persistence via IndexedDB (Dexie), with automatic migration from legacy localStorage
- `CategoryService` - Category hierarchy management
- `ActivityService` - Calendar activity logging
- `TripService` - Trip planning functionality

### 4. Context Layer (`src/context`)

React context providers for global concerns:

- `AuthProvider` - Authentication state initialization
- `ToastProvider` - Global notification system
- `useAlreadyLoggedInRedirect` - Auth-based routing utility
