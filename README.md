## üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture

This application follows a clean, three-layer architecture to ensure a clear separation of concerns.

### 1. UI Layer (Components & Pages)

- **Location:** `src/pages` & `src/components`
- **Description:** Contains all React components. `pages` are top-level views corresponding to routes, while `components` hold reusable UI elements (e.g., `Modal`, `Button`, `StatCard`).
- **Routing:** Handled by `react-router-dom` in `src/App.jsx`, which defines separate layouts for public (`PublicLayout`) and protected (`AppLayout`) routes.

### 2. State Management Layer (Zustand)

- **Location:** `src/stores`
- **Description:** This layer is the "single source of truth" for the application's state. It uses Zustand to create multiple, feature-specific stores (e.g., `useWardrobeStore`, `useAuthStore`, `useCalendarStore`).
- **Data Flow:** Components subscribe to these stores to get data. When they need to change something, they call an "action" in the store. The action then calls the appropriate service to perform the logic and update the data.

### 3. Service Layer

- **Location:** `src/services`
- **Description:** Contains all the core business logic and data persistence. Each service is a stateless collection of asynchronous functions with a single responsibility (e.g., `ClothService` handles all logic related to clothes).
- **Data Persistence:** All services currently use the `StorageService` to read from and write to the browser's `localStorage`. To connect to a real backend, one would only need to modify the `StorageService` to make API calls instead.

## üì¶ Core Data Models

- **Cloth:** Represents a single clothing item (`id`, `name`, `categoryId`, `status`, `currentWearCount`).
- **Outfit:** Represents a collection of clothes (`id`, `name`, `clothIds`).
- **Category:** Represents a category or subcategory (`id`, `name`, `parentId`, `maxWearCount`).
- **ActivityLog:** A record of an outfit or cloth being worn on a specific date (`id`, `date`, `type`, `outfitId`/`clothIds`).
